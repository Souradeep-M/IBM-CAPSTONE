It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in London based on the total crimes, explore the neighborhoods of that borough to find the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood and finally cluster the neighborhoods using k-mean clustering.\n",

Inorder to finalise a neighborhood to hunt for an apartment, safety is considered as a top concern when moving to a new place. If you don’t feel safe in your own home, you’re not going to be able to enjoy living there. The crime statistics will provide an insight into this issue.\n",
